To develop a new feature for a given OPAL project

* From the gitlab webpage, select the project in the drop down box (e.g. ```OPAL/src```)
* Click on the ```project``` link in the top menu bar. This will take you to a page showing the uri for cloning the repository and a few other options. 
* Next to the uri there is a button marked ```fork```; click on it.
* You can build a fork against different groups of which you are a member, or against your username. Click on one of these to build a fork.
* ```Forking in progress``` appears. Now wait (this can take a few minutes).
* If the fork is built successfully, a URI to the new fork should be shown. On your development machine, copy the url to the clip board and do ```git clone <new repository>```
* Add the central repository as a _remote_ ```git remote add upstream <original repository>``` (e.g. for OPAL, <original repository> might be ```git@gitlab.psi.ch:OPAL/src.git```

Write some code. When you are ready to put the code back into the upstream repository

* Check that everything builds and tests pass
* Check changes against style guide
* Tell git which files you would like to commit ```git add <filename1> <filename2>```
* Commit the files locally on your development machine ```git commit -m "Description of changes"```
* Merge changes from upstream ```git merge upstream```
* Check that everything still builds and tests pass
* If there are conflicts, you may need to modify the codel then go back through the ```git add``` and ```git commit``` process. 
* When you are ready, push your code back to gitlab by doing ```git push```
* In your branch, click on the ```merge request``` link and select a reviewer from the list.
* The reviewer will determine if the code is okay to merge. 
* The reviewer clicks ```accept merge request``` and the code is merged back to the upstream repository; now watch the nightly builds...
