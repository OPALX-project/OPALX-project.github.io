To develop a new feature for a given OPAL project

* From the gitlab webpage, select the project in the drop down box (e.g. _OPAL/src_)
* Click on the "project" link in the top menu bar. This will take you to a page showing the uri for cloning the repository and a few other options. 
* Next to the uri there is a button marked "fork"; click on it.
* You can build a fork against different groups of which you are a member, or against your username. Click on one of these to build a fork.
* "Forking in progress" appears. Now wait (this can take a few minutes).
* If the fork is built successfully, a URI to the new fork should be shown. On your development machine, copy the url to the clip board and do ```git clone <new repository>```
* git remote add upstream git@gitlab.psi.ch:OPAL/src.git

Write some code. When you are ready to do a commit...

* check against style guide
* git add

* check that everything builds and tests pass
* check against style guide
