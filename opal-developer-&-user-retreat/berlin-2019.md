The retreat takes place at HZB in Berlin-Adlershof from 1st to 4th of April 2019. All participants meet at 9 am on 1st of April in front of the main entrance ([here]( https://www.google.de/maps/place/52%C2%B025'41.2%22N+13%C2%B031'55.6%22E/@52.4281257,13.5314692,213m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d52.428102!4d13.532096)). Please contact me (Christof) on my mobile phone (+49 179 427 94 34) or by email if you're late.

Timetables for train, subway/underground, tram and bus can be found under https://www.bvg.de/en , information about the Adlershof campus under https://www.adlershof.de and restaurants on the campus under https://www.adlershof.de/gastronomie-speiseplaene/menues/, a map of the campus under https://www.adlershof.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/anfahrt-lage/WISTA-Orientierungsplan-Technologiepark-Adlershof.pdf.

[Here is a map of the train and subway/underground network](/uploads/b195865d854d0864b326e30bf4fe3a2c/S_und_U-Bahnnetz_mit_Regionalbahn_Berlin_ABC.jpg) where I highlighted the train stop Adlershof (in red) as well as the two airports in green. To get from Tegel to Adlershof or from Adlershof to the city center you'll need a ticket AB, from Schönefeld you'll need a ticket BC. These tickets are valid on all public transport vehicles for trips in one direction and within the zones (AB, BC or ABC). Day tickets are valid from the moment you validate it until 3 am the next day. There also exist tickets for 4 or 5 days but they are probably more expensive than buying one for each trip. The tickets can be bought on the platform (train/subway/tram), at the bus driver or on your mobile phone ([android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.bvg.ticket) / [apple](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/bvg-tickets/id1232772818?mt=8)). Please remember to validate your ticket on the platform (wine-red boxes)!
