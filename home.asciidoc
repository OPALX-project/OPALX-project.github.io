== Introduction

_OPAL_ (Object Oriented Parallel Accelerator Library) is a parallel open source tool for charged-particle optics in linear accelerators and rings, including 3D space charge.
Using the MAD language with extensions, _OPAL_ can run on a laptop as well as on the largest high performance computing systems.
_OPAL_ is built from the ground up as a parallel application exemplifying the fact that high performance computing is the third leg of science, complementing theory and experiment.

The _OPAL_ framework makes it easy to add new features in the form of new C++ classes.
_OPAL_ comes in the following flavours:

* _OPAL-cycl_:
  tracks particles with 3D space charge including neighbouring turns in
  cyclotrons and FFAs with time as the independent variable.
* _OPAL-t_:
  models beam lines, linacs, rf-photo injectors and
  complete XFELs excluding the undulator.
* _OPAL-map_:
  map tracking (experimental).

The code is managed through the Git distributed version control system. A suite of unit tests have been developed for various parts of _OPAL_, validating each part of the code independently. Unit tests use the google testing framework. System tests validate the overall integration of different elements. Documentation is written in Asciidoc. Tools are available to readily convert Asciidoc into formats such as PDF and HTML for display.

Please use the _OPAL_ mailing list {mail_mailing_list} to discuss problems and issues. Subscribe to the {link_mailing_list}[**mailing list**].

Please report bugs and feature requests to the {link_issue_tracker}[issue tracker] or to the mailing list.

Documentation about installing and running the _OPAL_ binary package is available link:OPAL-binary-package[here].

A ChangeLog of the binary packages is available link:OPAL-binary-package-ChangeLog[here].

Older version can be found link:OPAL-binary-package-old-versions[here].

=== Git repository

Instead of downloading the source tar-ball you can get the _OPAL_ source via Git. Either clone the whole Git repository (~ 2 GB!) with
[source,sh,subs="attributes"] 
----
git clone {link_repo}.git
----

or clone a specific branch/tag with
[source,sh,subs="attributes"] 
----
git clone --single-branch --depth 1  --branch BRANCH_OR_TAG {link_repo}.git [DIR]
----

== Tools
The runOPAL.py Script::
The link:runOPAL[runOPAL] Python scripts allows you to run, automated, several OPAL jobs and obtain the data in a conceived way. Scans of multiple dimensions are easy to perform.

Post Processing and pyOPALTools::
The {link_pyopaltools}/wikis/home[pyOPALTools] Python package contains many tools for pre- and postprocessing, and analysing and plotting output data.
See also link:postprocessing[Post Processing].
