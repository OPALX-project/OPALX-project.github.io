== Operating systems

The following operating systems are supported:

* Linux
** Redhat Enterprise Linux
** Suse Leap
** Ubuntu
** ...
* macOS
* Windows (with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL))

== Required software

Linux:: the usual standard and development tools like gcc, autotools, cmake, make, lex/flex, yacc/bison, tar, bzip2 ...

macOS:: Xcode, command line tools, for some features Macports or Homebrew

Windows:: use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Before compiling everything yourself, you might want to try the versions available on your system. Check the requirements below before trying. 
The list below shows the required software, the minimal and
the recommended version.

|=======
| **Name**  | **recommended Versions** | **Notes**

| cmake | 3.20.5 or newer
| 

| C/C&#43;&#43; Compiler | gcc 10 or Clang 12
| must support C&#43;&#43; 17 or better. Minimum version for GCC is 8.4.0. If this or a newer version is available on your system, use it. If you want/have to compile GCC yourself, see the instructions below.

| Fortran Compiler | gfortran 10
| optional, must support Fortan 95 or better.

| MPI | Open MPI 4.0.5 +
        MPICH 3
| If MPI is installed on your system or available as environment module, use it. In most cases this works better than compiling MPI yourself.

| zlib | 1.2.11
| use system zlib if available (`libz.a` or `libz.so`)

| hdf5 | 1.10.7
| A parallel version is required.

| GNU Scientific Library | 2.7
|

| VTK | ?
| optional: required if you want to compile H5hut with the VTK to H5hut mesh converter.

| H5hut | 2.0.0rc6
| A parallel version is required.

| boost | 1.76.0
| The following boost libraries are required: `chrono`, `filesystem`,
 `iostreams`, `regex`, `serialization`, `system`, `timer`

| ParMETIS | 4.0.3
| optional: required for OPAL compiled with SAAMG solver.

| OpenBLAS | 0.3.15 or newer
| optional: required for OPAL compiled with SAAMG solver.

| trilinos | 13.0.1 
| optional: required for OPAL compiled with SAAMG solver.

| AMReX | 18.07
| optional: required for OPAL compiled with AMR solvers.

| MITHRA | 2.0
| optional: required for OPAL compiled with FEL simulation.

| google-test | 1.10.0 or newer
| optional: Required to run the unit-tests

== Compiler

=== GNU Compiler Collection

The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is the recommended compiler for _OPAL_
on a Linux system and on Windows with the Windows Services for
Linux. If you want to use GCC on macOS, it is recommended to
use GCC provided by Macports, Homebrew, Fink or another software
package manager.  

> **NOTE:** If you do not want to use the compilers provided by the
    system (Linux distribution, Xcode,...), make sure that the
    commands `cc` and `c&#43;&#43;` are calling the right binary. At least
    with GCC from Macports `cc` and `c&#43;&#43;` are not set with `port select`.

|=======
| **Name**
| **recommended Versions**
| **Notes**

| GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)
| 6.2.1 or newer
| optional: if you want to compile GCC

| GNU MPFR Library
| 4.1.0
| optional: if you want to compile GCC

| GNU MPC Library
| 1.2.1
| optional: if you want to compile GCC

|=======

=== Clang/LLVM (macOS only)

Clang is the recommended compiler for OPAL on macOS - as long as you
do not need AMR. If you want to compile OPAL with AMR, a Fortran
compiler is required. In this case you can either use the new Flang
front-end of LLVM or GCC from one of the package managers.

> *Note:* The LLVM Fortran front-end Flang is not included in
   Xcode. You have to compile it yourself.
