# Goal
Here we will run the Cyclotron flavour of OPAL (OPAL_cyc) in three distinct modes
1. tune calculation
2. accelerated orbit mode
3. 3D space charge

# Preparation
If you do not have already access to OPAL, you can visit the download page (https://amas.psi.ch/OPAL/wiki/Downloads) . In
case OPAL is on your cluster please check with the administrator how to use. PSI user please click [here](opalmerlin). 

# Needed Input Files
For this project we need 3 types of input files:
1. cyclotron1.in (cyclotron2.in, cyclotron2.in)
2. bfieldmap.dat (magnetic field map)
3. rffieldmap1.dat and rffieldmap2.dat (rf field maps)
