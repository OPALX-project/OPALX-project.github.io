*I recommend booking a placeholder soon (if you want a traditional hotel).
Closest towns are Redwood City, Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Sunnyvale.
Here’s a list of Sunnyvale options our admin has used in the past:*

* Wild Palms Hotel Sunnyvale
* Cherry orchard Inn Sunnyvale
* Courtyard by Marriott Hotel Cupertino
* AC Hotel by Marriott Sunnyvale
* Cupertino Inn

*Public transportation is available by bus (leaving from campus), on 30 minute intervals during the day (~7am to ~8pm):
