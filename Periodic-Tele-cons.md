2. If Suzy is not answering by Friday I will divide the work of english checking among Nicole, Daniel and 
Chris. THANKS A LOT! 


3. OPAL Retreat SLAC 2020 (March 30 to April 3)

*I recommend booking a placeholder soon (if you want a traditional hotel).
Closest towns are Redwood City, Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Sunnyvale.
Here’s a list of Sunnyvale options our admin has used in the past:*

* Wild Palms Hotel Sunnyvale
* Cherry orchard Inn Sunnyvale
* Courtyard by Marriott Hotel Cupertino
* AC Hotel by Marriott Sunnyvale
* Cupertino Inn

*Public transportation is available by bus (leaving from campus), on 30 minute intervals during the day (~7am to ~8pm):

Due to problems with the original date we evaluating the following **alternative: Feb 17 to 22**. By Christmas we should have a decision. 

4. Nicole will make a Doodle for a monthly meeting plan. We start one hour earlier.

5. The Manual workflow as it is was not debated. A great plus is the ability to do small changes with the 
*edit button* hence without going to the entire workflow. 

6. None
