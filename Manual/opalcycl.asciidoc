_OPAL-cycl_
-----------

[[introduction]]
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

_OPAL-cycl_, as one of the flavors of the _OPAL_ framework, is a fully
three-dimensional parallel beam dynamics simulation program dedicated to
future high intensity cyclotrons and FFAG. it tracks multiple particles
which takes into account the space charge effects. For the first time in
the cyclotron community, _OPAL-cycl_ has the capability of tracking
multiple bunches simultaneously and take into account the beam-beam
effects of the radially neighboring bunches (we call it neighboring
bunch effects for short) by using a self-consistent numerical simulation
model.

Apart from the multi-particle simulation mode, _OPAL-cycl_ also has two
other serial tracking modes for conventional cyclotron machine design.
One mode is the single particle tracking mode, which is a useful tool
for the preliminary design of a new cyclotron. It allows one to compute
basic parameters, such as reference orbit, phase shift history, stable
region, and matching phase ellipse. The other one is the tune
calculation mode, which can be used to compute the betatron oscillation
frequency. This is useful for evaluating the focusing characteristics of
a given magnetic field map.

In addition, the widely used plugin elements, including collimator,
radial profile probe, septum, trim-coil field and charge stripper, are
currently implemented in _OPAL-cycl_. These functionalities are very
useful for designing, commissioning and upgrading of cyclotrons and
FFAGs.

[[tracking-modes]]
Tracking modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to the number of particles defined by the argument `npart` in
`beam` see Chapter link:beam[Beam Command], _OPAL-cycl_ works in one of the following
three operation modes automatically.

[[single-particle-tracking-mode]]
Single Particle Tracking mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this mode, only one particle is tracked, either with acceleration or
not. Working in this mode, _OPAL-cycl_ can be used as a tool during the
preliminary design phase of a cyclotron.

The 6D parameters of a single particle in the initial local frame must
be read from a file. To do this, in the _OPAL_ input file, the command
line `DISTRIBUTION` see Chapter link:distribution[Distribution] should be defined like
this:

....
  Dist1: DISTRIBUTION, TYPE=fromfile, FNAME="PartDatabase.dat";
....

where the file _PartDatabase.dat_ should have two lines:

....
 1
 0.001 0.001   0.001   0.001   0.001  0.001
....

The number in the first line is the total number of particles. In the
second line the data represents
latexmath:[x, p_x, y,]latexmath:[ p_y, z, p_z] in the local
reference frame. Their units are described in
Section <<sec:variablesopalcycl>>.

Please don’t try to run this mode in parallel environment. You should
believe that a single processor of the latexmath:[21^{st}] century is capable of doing
the single particle tracking.

[[tune-calculation-mode]]
Tune Calculation mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this mode, two particles are tracked, one with all data is set to
zero is the reference particle and another one is an off-centering
particle which is off-centered in both latexmath:[r] and
latexmath:[z] directions. Working in this mode, _OPAL-cycl_ can
calculate the betatron oscillation frequency latexmath:[\nu_r] and
latexmath:[\nu_z] for different energies to evaluate the focusing
characteristics for a given magnetic field.

Like the single particle tracking mode, the initial 6D parameters of the
two particles in the local reference frame must be read from a file,
too. In the file should has three lines:

....
 2
 0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0
 0.001 0.0   0.0   0.0   0.001  0.0
....

When the total particle number equals 2, this mode is triggered
automatically. Only the element `CYCLOTRON` in the beam line is used and
other elements are omitted if any exists.

Please don’t try to run this mode in parallel environment, either.

[[multi-particle-tracking-mode]]
Multi-particle tracking mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this mode, large scale particles can be tracked simultaneously,
either with space charge or not, either single bunch or multi-bunch,
either serial or parallel environment, either reading the initial
distribution from a file or generating a typical distribution, either
running from the beginning or restarting from the last step of a former
simulation.

Because this is the main mode as well as the key part of _OPAL-cycl_, we
will describe this in detail in Section <<sec:opalcycl:MultiBunch>>.

[[sec:variablesopalcycl]]
Variables in _OPAL-cycl_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_OPAL-cycl_ uses the following canonical variables to describe the
motion of particles:

X::
  Horizontal position latexmath:[x] of a particle in given global
  Cartesian coordinates [m].
PX::
  Horizontal canonical momentum [eV/c].
Y::
  Longitudinal position latexmath:[y] of a particle in global
  Cartesian coordinates [m].
PY::
  Longitudinal canonical momentum [eV/c].
Z::
  Vertical position latexmath:[z] of a particle in global Cartesian
  coordinates [m].
PZ::
  Vertical canonical momentum [eV/c].

The independent variable is: *t* [s].

[[sec:opalcycl:localframe]]
The initial distribution in the local reference frame
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The initial distribution of the bunch, either read from file or
generated by a distribution generator see Chapter link:distribution[Distribution], is
specified in the local reference frame of the _OPAL-cycl_ Cartesian
coordinate system see Section <<sec:opalcycl:canon>>. At the beginning of the
run, the 6 phase space variables latexmath:[(x, y, z, p_x, p_y, p_z)]
are transformed to the global Cartesian coordinates using the starting
coordinates latexmath:[r_0] (`RINIT`), latexmath:[\phi_0]
(`PHIINIT`), and latexmath:[z_0] (`ZINIT`), and the starting momenta
latexmath:[p_{r0}] (`PRINIT`), and latexmath:[p_{z0}] (`PZINIT`) of
the reference particle, defined in the `CYCLOTRON` element
see Section link:elements#sec:cyclotron[Cyclotron]. Note that latexmath:[p_{\phi 0}] is
calculated automatically from latexmath:[p_{total}],
latexmath:[p_{r0}], and latexmath:[p_{z0}].

\begin{aligned}
X &= x\cos(\phi_0) - y\sin(\phi_0) + r_0\cos(\phi_0)  \\

PZ &= p_z + p_{z0}\end{aligned}
++++

[[sec:opalcycl:fieldmap]]
Field Maps
~~~~~~~~~~

In _OPAL-cycl_, the magnetic field on the median plane is read from an
ASCII type file. The field data should be stored in the cylinder
coordinates frame (because the field map on the median plane of the
cyclotron is usually measured in this frame).

There are two possible situations. One is the real field map on median
plane of the exist cyclotron machine using measurement equipment.
Limited by the narrow gaps of magnets, in most cases with cyclotrons,
only vertical field latexmath:[B_z] on the median plane
(latexmath:[z=0]) is measured. Since the magnetic field data off the
median plane field components is necessary for those particles with
latexmath:[z \neq 0], the field need to be expanded in latexmath:[Z]
direction. According to the approach given by Gordon and Taivassalo, by
using a magnetic potential and measured latexmath:[B_z] on the median
plane, at the point latexmath:[(r,\theta, z)] in cylindrical polar
coordinates, the third order field can be written as

[#Bfield]
.Third order magnetic field equations
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{aligned}
  B_r(r,\theta, z) & = & z\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial r}-\frac{1}{6}z^3 C_r, \\
  B_\theta(r,\theta, z) & = & \frac{z}{r}\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial \theta}-\frac{1}{6}\frac{z^3}{r} C_{\theta}, \\
  B_z(r,\theta, z) & = & B_z-\frac{1}{2}z^2 C_z,  \end{aligned}
++++

where latexmath:[B_z\equiv B_z(r, \theta, 0)] and

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{aligned}
  C_r & = & \frac{\partial^{3}{B_z}}{\partial r^{3}} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial^{2}{B_z}}{\partial r^{2}} - \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial{B_z}}{\partial r}
        + \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial^{3}{B_z}}{{\partial r}{\partial \theta^2}} - 2\frac{1}{r^3}\frac{\partial^{2}{B_z}}{\partial \theta^{2}},  \\
  C_{\theta} & = & \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial^{2}{B_z}}{{\partial r}{\partial \theta}} + \frac{\partial^{3}{B_z}}{{\partial r^2}{\partial \theta}}
        + \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial^{3}{B_z}}{\partial \theta^{3}},  \\
  C_z & = & \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial{B_z}}{\partial r} + \frac{\partial^{2}{B_z}}{\partial r^{2}} + \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial^{2}{B_z}}{\partial \theta^{2}}. 
\end{aligned}
++++

All the partial differential coefficients are on the median plane and
can be calculated by interpolation. _OPAL-cycl_ uses Lagrange’s 5-point
formula.

The other situation is to calculate the field on the median plane or the
3D fields of the working gap for interesting region numerically by
creating 3D model using commercial software, such as TOSCA, ANSOFT and
ANSYS during the design phase of a new machine. If the field on the
median plane is calculated, the field off the median plane can be
obtained using the same expansion approach as the measured field map as
described above. However, the 3D fields of the entire working gap should
be more accurate than the expansion approach especially at the region
not so close to the median plane in latexmath:[Z] direction.

In the current version, we implemented the three specific type
field-read functions _Cyclotron::getFieldFromFile()_ of the median plane
fields. That which function is used is controlled by the parameters
`TYPE` of `CYCLOTRON` see Section link:elements#sec:cyclotron[Cyclotron] in the input file.

[[carboncycl-type]]
CARBONCYCL type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If `TYPE=CARBONCYCL`, the program requires the latexmath:[B_z] data
which is stored in a sequence shown in Figure <<CYCLField,1>>.

[#CYCLField]
.Figure 1: 2D field map on the median plane with primary direction corresponding to the azimuthal direction, secondary direction to the radial direction
image:./figures/cyclotron/CarbonFieldFormat.png[]

We need to add 6 parameters at the header of a plain latexmath:[B_z]
[kG] data file, namely, latexmath:[r_{min}] [mm],
latexmath:[\Delta r] [mm], latexmath:[\theta_{min}] [latexmath:[^{\circ}]],
latexmath:[\Delta \theta] [latexmath:[^{\circ}]], latexmath:[N_\theta] (total data
number in each arc path of azimuthal direction) and latexmath:[N_r]
(total path number along radial direction). If latexmath:[\Delta r] or
latexmath:[\Delta \theta] is decimal, one can set its negative
opposite number. For instance, if
latexmath:[\Delta \theta = \frac{1}{3}{^{\circ}}], the fourth line of
the header should be set to -3.0. Example showing the above explained
format:

....

                        ......
....

[[cyciae-type]]
CYCIAE type
^^^^^^^^^^^

If `TYPE=CYCIAE`, the program requires data format given by ANSYS10.0.
This function is originally for the 100MeV cyclotron of CIAE, whose
isochronous fields is numerically computed by by ANSYS. The median plane
fields data is output by reading the APDL (ANSYS Parametric Design
Language) script during the post-processing phase (you may need to do
minor changes to adapt your own cyclotron model):

....
/post1
resume,solu,db
csys,1
nsel,s,loc,x,0
nsel,r,loc,y,0
nsel,r,loc,z,0
PRNSOL,B,COMP

*do,count,0,200
   path,cyc100_Ansys,2,5,45
   ppath,1,,0.01*count,0,,1
   ppath,2,,0.01*count/sqrt(2),0.01*count/sqrt(2),,1

   pdef,bz,b,z
   paget,data,table

   *if,count,eq,0,then
      /output,cyc100_ANSYS,dat
      *STATUS,data,,,5,5
      /output
   *else
      /output,cyc100_ANSYS,dat,,append
      *STATUS,data,,,5,5
      /output
   *endif
*enddo
finish
....

By running this in ANSYS, you can get a fields file with the name
_cyc100_ANSYS.data_. You need to put 6 parameters at the header of the
file, namely, latexmath:[r_{min}] [mm], latexmath:[\Delta r] [mm],
latexmath:[\theta_{min}] [latexmath:[^{\circ}]], latexmath:[\Delta \theta] [latexmath:[^{\circ}]],
latexmath:[N_\theta](total data number in each arc path of azimuthal
direction) and latexmath:[N_r](total path number along radial
direction). If latexmath:[\Delta r] or latexmath:[\Delta \theta] is
decimal,one can set its negative opposite number. This is useful is the
decimal is unlimited. For instance,if
latexmath:[\Delta \theta = \frac{1}{3} {^{\circ}}], the fourth line of
the header should be -3.0. In a word, the fields are stored in the
following format:

[[bandrf-type]]
BANDRF type
^^^^^^^^^^^

If `TYPE=BANDRF`, the program requires the latexmath:[B_z] data format
which is same as `CARBONCYCL`. But with `BANDRF` type, the program can
also read in the 3D electric field(s). For the detail about its usage,
please see Section link:elements#sec:cyclotron[Cyclotron].

[[default-psi-format]]
Default PSI format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the value of `TYPE` is other string rather than above mentioned, the
program requires the data format like PSI format field file _ZYKL9Z.NAR_
and _SO3AV.NAR_, which was given by the measurement. We add 4 parameters
at the header of the file, namely, latexmath:[r_{min}] [mm],
latexmath:[\Delta r] [mm], latexmath:[\theta_{min}][latexmath:[^{\circ}]],
latexmath:[\Delta \theta][latexmath:[^{\circ}]], If latexmath:[\Delta r] or
latexmath:[\Delta \theta] is decimal,one can set its negative opposite
number. This is useful is the decimal is unlimited. For instance,if
latexmath:[\Delta \theta = \frac{1}{3}{^{\circ}}], the fourth line of
the header should be -3.0.

[[d-field-map]]
3D field-map
^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is additionally possible to load 3D field-maps for tracking through
_OPAL-cycl_. 3D field-maps are loaded by sequentially adding new field
elements to a line, as is done in _OPAL-t_. It is not possible to add RF
cavities while operating in this mode. In order to define ring
parameters such as initial ring radius a `RINGDEFINITION` type is loaded
into the line, followed by one or more `SBEND3D` elements.

....
ringdef: RINGDEFINITION, HARMONIC_NUMBER=6, LAT_RINIT=2350.0, LAT_PHIINIT=0.0,
         LAT_THETAINIT=0.0, BEAM_PHIINIT=0.0, BEAM_PRINIT=0.0,
         BEAM_RINIT=2266.0, SYMMETRY=4.0, RFFREQ=0.2;

The field-map with file name _fdf-tosca-field-map.table_ is loaded,
which is a file like

The header parameters are ignored - user supplied parameters
`LENGTH_UNITS` and `FIELD_UNITS` are used. Fields are supplied on points
in a grid in latexmath:[(r, y, \phi)]. Positions and field elements
are specified by Cartesian coordinates latexmath:[(x, y, z)].

[[users-own-field-map]]
User’s own field-map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should revise the function or write your own function according to
the instructions in the code to match your own field format if it is
different to above types. For more detail about the parameters of
`CYCLOTRON`, please refer to Section link:elements#sec:cyclotron[Cyclotron].

[[sec:opalcycl:rffieldmap]]
RF field
~~~~~~~~

[[read-rf-voltage-profile]]
Read RF voltage profile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The RF cavities are treated as straight lines with infinitely narrow
gaps and the electric field is a latexmath:[\delta] function plus a
transit time correction. the two-gap cavity is treated as two
independent single-gap cavities. the spiral gap cavity is not
implemented yet. For more detail about the parameters of cyclotron
cavities, see Section link:elements#sec:cyclotron[Cyclotron].

The voltage profile of a cavity gap is read from ASCII file. Here is an
example:

....
6
0.00      0.15      2.40
0.20      0.65      2.41
0.40      0.98      0.66
0.60      0.88     -1.59
0.80      0.43     -2.65
1.00     -0.05     -1.71
....

The number in the first line means 6 sample points and in the following
lines the three values represent the normalized distance to the inner
edge of the cavity, the normalized voltage and its derivative
respectively.

[[read-3d-rf-field-map]]
Read 3D RF field-map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 3D RF field-map can be read from H5hut type file. This is useful for
modeling the central region electric fields which usually has complicate
shapes. For the detail about its usage, please see Section link:elements#sec:cyclotron[Cyclotron].

Please note that in this case, the E field is treated as a part of
`CYCLOTRON` element, rather than a independent `RFCAVITY` element.

[[particle-tracking-and-acceleration]]
Particle Tracking and Acceleration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The precision of the tracking methods is vital for the entire simulation
process, especially for long distance tracking jobs. _OPAL-cycl_ uses a
fourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm and the second order Leap-Frog
scheme. The fourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm needs four external
magnetic field evaluation in each time step latexmath:[\tau]. During
the field interpolation process, for an arbitrary given point the code
first interpolates Formula latexmath:[B_z] for its counterpart on the
median plane and then expands to this given point using
Equation_<<Bfield,1>>.

After each time step latexmath:[i], the code detects whether the
particle crosses any one of the RF cavities during this step. If it
does, the time point latexmath:[t_c] of crossing is calculated and the
particle return back to the start point of step latexmath:[i]. Then
this step is divided into three sub-steps: first, the code tracks this
particle for latexmath:[ t_1 = \tau - (t_c-t_{i-1})]; then it
calculates the voltage and adds momentum kick to the particle and
refreshes its relativistic parameters latexmath:[\beta] and
latexmath:[\gamma]; and then tracks it for
latexmath:[t_2 = \tau - t_1].

[[space-charge]]
Space Charge
~~~~~~~~~~~~

_OPAL-cycl_ uses the same solvers as _OPAL-t_ to calculate the space
charge effects see Chapter link:fieldsolvers[Field Solver].

Typically, the space charge field is calculated once per time step. This
is no surprise for the second order Boris-Buneman time integrator
(leapfrog-like scheme) which has per default only one force evaluation
per step. The fourth order Runge-Kutta integrator keeps the space charge
field constant for one step, although there are four external field
evaluations. There is an experimental multiple-time-stepping (MTS)
variant of the Boris-Buneman/leapfrog-method, which evaluates space
charge only every N^th step, thus greatly reducing computation time
while usually being still accurate enough.

[[sec:opalcycl:MultiBunch]]
Multi-bunch Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The neighboring bunches problem is motivated by the fact that for high
intensity cyclotrons with small turn separation, single bunch space
charge effects are not the only contribution. Along with the increment
of beam current, the mutual interaction of neighboring bunches in radial
direction becomes more and more important, especially at large radius
where the distances between neighboring bunches get increasingly small
and even they can overlap each other. One good example is PSI 590MeV
Ring cyclotron with a current of about 2mA in CW operation and the beam
power amounts to 1.2MW. An upgrade project for Ring is in process with
the goal of 1.8MW CW on target by replacing four old aluminum resonators
by four new copper cavities with peak voltage increasing from about
0.7MW to above 0.9MW. After upgrade, the total turn number is reduced
from 200 turns to less than 170 turns. Turn separation is increased a
little bit, but still are at the same order of magnitude as the radial
size of the bunches. Hence once the beam current increases from 2mA to
3mA, the mutual space charge effects between radially neighboring
bunches can have significant impact on beam dynamics. In consequence, it
is important to cover neighboring bunch effects in the simulation to
quantitatively study its impact on the beam dynamics.

In _OPAL-cycl_, we developed a new fully consistent algorithm of
multi-bunch simulation. We implemented two working modes, namely ,
`AUTO` and `FORCE`. In the first mode, only a single bunch is tracked
and accelerated at the beginning, until the radial neighboring bunch
effects become an important factor to the bunches’ behavior. Then the
new bunches will be injected automatically to take these effects into
account. In this way, we can save time and memory, and more important,
we can get higher precision for the simulation in the region where
neighboring bunch effects are important. In the other mode, multi-bunch
simulation starts from the injection points.

In the space charge calculation for multi-bunch, the computation region
covers all bunches. Because the energy of the bunches is quite
different, it is inappropriate to use only one particle rest frame and a
single Lorentz transformation any more. So the particles are grouped
into different energy bins and in each bin the energy spread is
relatively small. We apply Lorentz transforming, calculate the space
charge fields and apply the back Lorentz transforming for each bin
separately. Then add the field data together. Each particle has a ID
number to identify which energy bin it belongs to.

[[input]]
Input
~~~~~

All the three working modes of _OPAL-cycl_ use an input file written in
`mad` language which will be described in detail in the following
chapters.

For the *Tune Calculation mode*, one additional auxiliary file with the
following format is needed.

....
   72.000 2131.4   -0.240
   74.000 2155.1   -0.296
   76.000 2179.7   -0.319
   78.000 2204.7   -0.309
   80.000 2229.6   -0.264
   82.000 2254.0   -0.166
   84.000 2278.0    0.025
....

In each line the three values represent energy latexmath:[E], radius
latexmath:[r] and latexmath:[P_r] for the SEO (Static Equilibrium
Orbit) at starting point respectively and their units are MeV, mm and
mrad.

A bash script _tuning.sh_ is shown on the next page, to execute
_OPAL-cycl_ for tune calculations.

link:examples/tuning.sh[]

To start execution, just run
_tuning.sh_ which uses the input file _testcycl.in_ and the auxiliary
file _FIXPO_ SEO_. The output file is _plotdata_ from which one can plot
the tune diagram.

[[output]]
Output

[[single-particle-tracking-mode-1]]
Single Particle Tracking mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The intermediate phase space data is stored in an ASCII file which can
be used to the plot the orbit. The file’s name is combined by input file
name (without extension) and _-trackOrbit.dat_. The data are stored in
the global Cartesian coordinates. The frequency of the data output can
be set using the option `SPTDUMPFREQ` of `OPTION` statement
see Section link:control#sec:option[Option Statement].

The phase space data per `STEPSPERTURN` (a parameter in the `TRACK`
command) steps is stored in an ASCII file. The file’s name is a
combination of input file name (without extension) and
_-afterEachTurn.dat_. The data is stored in the global cylindrical
coordinate system. Please note that if the field map is ideally
isochronous, the reference particle of a given energy take exactly one
revolution in `STEPPERTURN` steps; Otherwise, the particle may not go
through a full 360^ in `STEPPERTURN` steps.

There are 3 ASCII files which store the phase space data around
latexmath:[0], latexmath:[\pi/8] and latexmath:[\pi/4] azimuths.
Their names are the combinations of input file name (without extension)
and _-Angle0.dat_, _-Angle1.dat_ and _-Angle2.dat_ respectively. The
data is stored in the global cylindrical coordinate system, which can be
used to check the property of the closed orbit.

[[tune-calculation-mode-1]]
Tune calculation mode
+++++++++++++++++++++

The tunes latexmath:[\nu_r] and latexmath:[\nu_z] of each energy are
stored in a ASCII file with name _tuningresult_.

[[multi-particle-tracking-mode-1]]
Multi-particle tracking mode
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The intermediate phase space data of all particles and some interesting
parameters, including RMS envelop size, RMS emittance, external field,
time, energy, length of path, number of bunches and tracking step, are
stored in the H5hut file-format <<bib:howison2010>> and can be analyzed
using the H5root <<bib:schietinger>>. The frequency of the data output can
be set using the `PSDUMPFREQ` option of `OPTION` statement
see Section link:control#sec:option[Option Statement].
The file is named like the input file but the
extension is _.h5_.

The intermediate phase space data of central particle (with ID of 0) and
an off-centering particle (with ID of 1) are stored in an ASCII file.
The file’s name is combined by the input file name (without extension)
and _-trackOrbit.dat_. The frequency of the data output can be set using
the `SPTDUMPFREQ` option of `OPTION` statement see Section link:control#sec:option[Option Statement].

[[matched-distribution]]
Matched Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to run matched distribution simulation one has to specify a
periodic accelerator. The function call also needs the symmetry of the
machine as well as a field map. The user then specifies the emittance
latexmath:[\pi{mmmrad}].

....
/*
 * specify periodic accelerator
 */
l1 = ...

/*
 * try finding a matched distribution
 */
Dist1:DISTRIBUTION, TYPE=GAUSSMATCHED, LINE=l1, FMAPFN=...,
                    MAGSYM=..., EX = ..., EY = ..., ET = ...;
....

[[example]]
Example
^^^^^^^

Simulation of the PSI Ring Cyclotron at 580MeV and current 2.2mA. The
program finds a matched distribution followed by a bunch initialization
according to the matched covariance matrix. +
The matched distribution algorithm works with normalized emittances,
i.e. normalized by the lowest energy of the machine. The printed
emittances, however, are the geometric emittances. In addition, it has
to be paid attention that the computation is based on
latexmath:[(x,x',y,y',z,\delta)] instead of
latexmath:[(x,p_{x},y,p_{y},z,p_{z})]. Since the particles are
represented in the latter coordinate system, the corresponding
transformation has to be applied to obtain the rms emittances that are
given in the output.
