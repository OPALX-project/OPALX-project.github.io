[[chp:sample]]
Sampler
--------
This is a modification of the https://gitlab.psi.ch/OPAL/src/wikis/Manual/optimiser[`optimiser` optimizser]. Instead of performing a multi-objective optimisation, it creates samples
of the the design variables and runs those simulations. This feature can be used for example as training / validation of neural networks or uncertainty quantification (UQ).

OPAL Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It uses almost the same syntax as the optimiser.
