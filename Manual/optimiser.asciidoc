Multi Objective Optimisation
----------------------------

Optimization methods deal with finding a feasible set of solutions
corresponding to extreme values of some specific criteria. Problems
consisting of more than one criterion are called _multi-objective
optimization problems_. Multiple objectives arise naturally in many real
world optimization problems, such as portfolio optimization, design,
planning and many more [pgnl:06,zepv:00,gala:98,yrss:09,basi:05]. It is
important to stress that multi-objective problems are in general harder
and more expensive to solve than single-objective optimization problems.

In this chapter we introduce multi-objective optimization problems and
discuss techniques for their solution with an emphasis on evolutionary
algorithms.

NOTE: For multi-objective optimization OPAL uses https://gitlab.psi.ch/OPAL/opt-pilot/[`opt-pilot`] developed by Y. Ineichen. `opt-pilot` has been fully integrated into OPAL. Instructions can be found on the https://gitlab.psi.ch/OPAL/opt-pilot/wikis/home[`opt-pilot` wiki page].

[[definition]]
Definition
~~~~~~~~~~

As with single-objective optimization problems, multi-object
optimization problems consist of a solution vector and optionally a
number of equality and inequality constraints. Formally, a general
multi-objective optimization problem has the form

[[eq:moop:obj]]
[[eq:moop:constr]]
[[eq:moop:dvar]]
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{aligned}
  \mathrm{min}  \quad & \quad f_m(\mathbf{x}),        & m &= \{1, \ldots, M\} \\
  \mathrm{s.t.} \quad & \quad g_j(\mathbf{x}) \geq 0, & j &= \{1, \ldots, J\} \\
  \quad & \quad  -\infty \leq x_i^L \leq \mathbf{x}=x_i \leq x_i^U \leq \infty,& i &= \{0, \ldots, n \}.
\end{aligned}
++++

The latexmath:[M]
objectives ([eq:moop:obj]) are minimized, subject to latexmath:[J]
inequality constraints ([eq:moop:constr]). An latexmath:[n]-vector
([eq:moop:dvar]) contains all the design variables with appropriate
lower and upper bounds, constraining the design space.

In contrast to single-objective optimization the objective functions
span a multi-dimensional space in addition to the design variable space
– for each point in design space there exists a point in objective
space. The mapping from the latexmath:[n] dimensional design space to
the latexmath:[M] dimensional objective space visualized in
Figure <<fig:des_to_obj,1>> is often non-linear. This impedes the search for
optimal solutions and increases the computational cost as a result of
expensive objective function evaluation. Additionally, depending in
which of the two spaces the algorithm uses to determine the next step,
it can be difficult to assure an even sampling of both spaces
simultaneously.

A special subset of multi-objective optimization problems where all
objectives and constraints are linear, called _Multi-objective linear
programs_, exhibit formidable theoretical properties that facilitate
convergence proofs. In this thesis we strive to address arbitrary
multi-objective optimization problems with non-linear constraints and
objectives. No general convergence proofs are readily available for
these cases.

[[pareto-optimality]]
Pareto Optimality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most multi-objective optimization problems we have to deal with
conflicting objectives. Two objectives are conflicting if they possess
different minima. If all the mimima of all objectives coincide the
multi-objective optimization problem has only one solution. To
facilitate comparing solutions we define a partial ordering relation on
candidate solutions based on the concept of dominance. A solution is
said to dominate another solution if it is no worse than the other
solution in all objectives and if it is strictly better in at least one
objective. A more formal description of the dominance relation is given
in [deb:09].

The properties of the dominance relation include transitivity

[latexmath]
++++
x_1 \preceq x_2 \wedge x_2 \preceq x_3 \Rightarrow x_1 \preceq x_3 ,
++++

and asymmetricity, which is necessary for an unambiguous order relation

[latexmath]
++++
x_1 \preceq x_2 \Rightarrow x_2 \npreceq x_1 .
++++

Using the concept of dominance, the sought-after set of Pareto optimal
solution points can be approximated iteratively as the set of
non-dominated solutions.

The problem of deciding if a point truly belongs to the Pareto set is
NP-hard. As shown in Figure <<fig:pareto-def,2>> there exist "weaker"
formulations of Pareto optimality. Of special interest is the result
shown in [paya:01], where the authors present a polynomial (in the input
size of the problem and latexmath:[1/\varepsilon]) algorithm for
finding an approximation, with accuracy latexmath:[\varepsilon], of
the Pareto set for database queries.
