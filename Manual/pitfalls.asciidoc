Pitfalls and Limitations
------------------------

A loose collection of pitfalls that may be difficult to avoid in particular for new users but also experienced user might profit from this list.

Hard edge fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields that feature steps like hard edge fringe fields are strongly advised not to be used.
In sector magnets where particles have different path lengths inside the magnet they are kicked 1, 2 or even more steps more (or less) depending on position and momentum.
Combine it with big time steps and you'll observe strange effects like splitting beams.
