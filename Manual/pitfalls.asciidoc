Pitfalls and Limitations
------------------------

A loose collection of pitfalls that may be difficult to avoid in particular for new users but also experienced user might profit from this list.

Hard Edge Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields that feature steps like hard edge fringe fields are strongly advised not to be used.
In sector magnets where particles have different path lengths inside the magnet they are kicked 1, 2 or even more steps more (or less) depending on position and momentum.
Combine it with big time steps and you'll observe strange effects like splitting beams.

Very Short Active Elements / Big Time Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is similar to the problem with hard edge fields. This concerns elements that model electromagnetic devices whose lengths are very short and comparable to the time step. In there case a split of the bunch can be observed which is caused by the fact that some particles are kicked more often than others. The length of the time step should then be adapted to reduce this effect.
