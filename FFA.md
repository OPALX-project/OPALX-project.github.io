There are two methods to model FFAs in OPAL, using the OPAL-Cycl routines.

1. Tracking through an analytical field model (OPAL > 2.0).
2. Tracking through a 3D field map.

# Tracking through an analytical field model

OPAL uses a fully scaling field model including scaling fringe fields to model FFAs. A sample lattice file is available here:
